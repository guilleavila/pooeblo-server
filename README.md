Pooeblo is our final project of the Ironhack web development bootcamp. 
It is a SPA (Single Page Application) created with React, which consumes its data from a REST API (mongoDB) 
through an express server.

Our passion for villages and our desire to live in one of them led us to the idea 
of this project. Pooeblo was born with the aim of bringing young people closer to villages, 
without the need to invest in a property, and generating interest and benefit in villages 
with few inhabitants.

The users of the application can be both individuals and villages, who use the platform 
to make themselves known and attract new residents. 

People can search for villages, see their characteristics, and find out about available houses. 
If they are interested in any of them, they can create a subscription to that house, 
with a certain number of days to spend within a year. Reservations to the subscribed houses 
are managed individually and independently from the creation of the subscription.

Users can also publish their houses so that other users can subscribe and create bookings.
